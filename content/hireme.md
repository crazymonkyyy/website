Hello truely wonderful corperate drone; nice suit you have there. Would you like a firm hand shake? or whatever shit.

I'm monkyyy, I program in D mostly, but if you need something done in a imperative friendly languge I could likely pick it up quick.

I believe in data oriented design, which is to say, you carefully design what the data looks like, then you just mutate the data in the easiest way possible.

I have a fiver, and a formal resume I could update, or could be a consultent, I dont care about those details. I'm just available for work.
