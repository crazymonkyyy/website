Heres an email update link that may work: https://mailchi.mp/1b14f5937da7/emails

and heres my tiny discord (where there is zero rules): https://discord.gg/PfX6R9CrFZ

I have zero tracking, and have no idea if anyone is reading save for one person who has emailed me at monkyyy@cocaine.ninja to say my rss feed didn't work for such a such program (which I dont know how to do anything about).

I like email updates *shrug*, I know I should use rss in thoery but like most things are spooky email and so.... I have one to.
