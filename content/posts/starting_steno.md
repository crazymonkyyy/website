Steno is an old tech to type with word cords, for whatever reason it's rare but they routinely win typing speed games to the point it's banned in that community. I see maybe 70% chance it has saner spelling than default English or I can grab a dictionary.

I don't understand the layout, it seems archaic and not actually responding to qwerty keyboards at all, I rotated my keycaps which helps especially the vowels.

I'm rather worried that it's overly optimized for the target of 240 words per minute when I realistically would like 100 with as little effort as possible to get a feel for the benefits of spelling since I CANT and will never be able to,

I kinda want a purely syllable-tic dictionary, cause it sounds like I do need to learn common words that are not matching the "one hand + thumbs + other hand" 3 letters sub-cords theory and it's like.... no. I don't want to know that 8 letter cord matches "how are you" id rather know those three cords.

"qwerty steno" seems like a sane resource, but I don't actually know.

I'm wondering if there is a mode in one of these tools to output 3 letters "words" that matches the starting consistently, middle vowel, ending consistent with a dash so I can output something with complex words I don't know: "si-nes-im" for scientism for example. I mean my communication is like that as is. When I'm not in an editor. and maybe I could write scripts that add it to a to-do list.

Should I "join the steno community" with whatever discords, or is that likely falling for a meme like when I tried Dvorak?
