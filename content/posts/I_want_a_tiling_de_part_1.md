I want a tiling desktop environment.

... let me explain:

So you normal computer user, everything you've known was based on the "desktop metaphor", your an office worker in the black and white days, and your work gets a doohicky that confuses you. You don't have time to learn anything, you need to work on the documents and fax them to management. So they made a half baked translation of your old work into what computers are doing. It's fucking awful, but its what they tried, so you would store your work in a filing cabinet, you would take labeled folders out of the filing cabinet to take to your desk and you would take files out of the folder to then edit; on your desktop. And for some godforsaken reason, because those papers would be moved manually, it was deemed more user friendly to make the "paper"/windows floating as if they were paper on a desk like fucking cavemen.

It was intended to be invisible and everyone got used to it, but it's wrong. In the modern era, after people used these computers for decades, you instantly full-screen everything or drag them to the side to spilt the screen in half. Because computers can and should manage windows for you. That splitting the window in half is weak tiling.

So the function of a window manager is to manage places for programs to draw their pictures, to then display them. A floating window manager is like a mother of 8 managing the pictures of children on the fridge using magnets, you drag around the taskbar/magnet to move the paper. A tiling window manager is like a well organized scrapbook, with pages/workspaces, you don't cover up a photo, you make new pages.

So what's the difference between a window manager and a desktop environment?, mostly scale; for example kde has a little thing to connect a phone to your computer in a fancy pants sharing clipboards, files and even emulating a mouse from the touch screen. Bspwm doesn't have an android app to emulate a mouse, bspwm is made up of a total of three binaries, I don't even know how to count how many kde has, but let's just say 1000.

Kde is an extreme example, what I would want would be more like lxde/qt project, maintaining a few dozen or so small "natural" projects, your notepads, your music players, all tied together so they look the same and have the same dependencies and have a bit of lube t make them fit together better.

As it stands tiling wm have a special requirement in that the wm have resize demands, not suggestions. For a well organized automated system, you must fit where you're placed, several simple apps simply don't or act weirdly. From the web the term is "reactive", finding apps that are adequately reactive is hard. Its simply not on any other projects checkbox that a window at 100x200 pixels should have some functionality, even if that app is a music player and that could easily fit a play and pause button.
