Freedom units are better then commie units.

But, well there are allot of dead units that should be depecated for prefix list techonology, with a rather simple suggestion that if you cant devide by 3, or 4 you dont belong in my kitchen.

So base 6, prefix list, a mini is 1/6th of the base unit and a very mini is a 1/36th of the unit. A big is 6 base units and a very big is 36 base units.

So, a very-mini-mile is 4ish very-big-feet.

and a mini-gallon is 2 and 2/3rd cups.

All other units are depercated.
