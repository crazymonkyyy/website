Ceasefire.net disappeared a while ago, less wrong banned me after 2 posts... I'm in need of a debate site.

I think you need 3 main things:

1. No bullshit karma system, making inarticulated disagreement invisible and therefore irrelevant

2. Moderation that cares only about prevent personal attacks

3. UI/design that supports long-form "quote response" discussion 

This apparently is unprofitable but I adore it so much.

If anyone at any time knows of such things please email me a link.
