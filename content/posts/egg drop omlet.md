In a medium fry pan, add a splash of water, soy sauce, and vinegar, to mostly coat the bottom of the pan; season with pepper and cayenne. Add a pat of butter.

When the broth is a rolling boil, crack in 4 eggs. Consider seasoning the egg yellows.

Lower heat to mid-high and occasionally poke holes thru the inner egg whites; to help them cook.

When egg whites are 90% set, add cheese and attempt(but fail) to fold.

After a bit, slide it out of the pan.
