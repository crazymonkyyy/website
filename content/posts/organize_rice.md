Hello, any /g/ ricing frens.

So, recently my computer had a hardware failure and I've been setting up a new programming computer, and well; my scripts, configs, and code while easy to pull off the hard drive, and were easy to get, But were wildly disorganized and hard to adapt to even minor changes.

So I've been piecemeal fixing/simplifying/reconfiguring my scripts and programs, without the very things I've grown relatent on.

So, simply I suggest you do this work, while you have access to a working copy.
