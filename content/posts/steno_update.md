Steno and its consequences have been disastrous for my typing speed.

![steno_maymay](/images/steno_maymay.png)

I have written scripts to generate my own finger spelling, sybols, and homophones disabiuation.

my original fear that this is over optinized realtime seems verified with how finger spelling and homophones where done.

I'm using a layout with 4 mod keys instead 2, but im feeling like 7 should be in my future.

Plz be patient, I'm ~~MAGA~~ learning steno.
