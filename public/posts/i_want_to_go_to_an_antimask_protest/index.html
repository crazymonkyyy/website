    <p>Naturally, I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;covid-denier&rdquo;; despite the fact I made a death toll prediction feb 5th before the medical estimement raised the alram, I did my speculating, made my conclusion, and stated it to an hyper critical audence saying I was anti-science for thinking it would be worse then sars. Dispite enaging with the most important bit of science I believe in, motivated prediction.</p>
<p><a href="https://ceasefire.net/post/a239z5/300000_poeple_will_die_this_year_from_corona_virus">Yes really. I predicted 300,000 deaths on feb 5th I will not be letting any one in any agrument on the topic off without explaining why they didn&rsquo;t have a reasonable attempt. Having the world disagree with you but being right is always suffocating.</a></p>
<p>&hellip;. I fucking hate it all. Do none of you see the frenzy your in, the mental agony your in for a illness that doesn&rsquo;t harm the young. Your very hard to love humanity.</p>
<p>I may as well restate my case again, any lockdown past the risk of medical shortages are a meme. The R0 is very very high, there is a point where everyone will be infected by an illness given a high enough R0. Any increase won&rsquo;t infect more poeple and by simple logic a decrease to that point won&rsquo;t save any lives either.</p>
<p>They did nothing when it mattered then over corrected and did everything when it didn&rsquo;t. Like an expecting mother who was on meth for the first 2 weeks of pregency, then converted to a cult that ate nothing but raw food. Exopental growth may take a bit but the outcome was set in motion. It will feel very unfair to that mother but I would rate the brith defect risk using numbers from methhead births.</p>
<p>Speaking of which we are close to 9 months since I&rsquo;ve heard; its getting rather old.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;ve asked 4chan, I tried reddit, I&rsquo;ve googled, I&rsquo;ve dug into new stories of past protests. 4chan and cnn are on the same page of &ldquo;<strong>PANIC</strong>&rdquo; and calling me crazy. And of course the majority of places feel censored. I want a local protest, I&rsquo;ll probaly be awkward, as they will antivaxxers probaly but&hellip;.. I don&rsquo;t know maybe it will be satisfying in some way.</p>
