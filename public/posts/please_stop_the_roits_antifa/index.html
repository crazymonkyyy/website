    <p>When this started, there was a video of a man being killed by police officers that generally speaking everyone agreed was murder. Today, that fact is disputed, there was a 17 year old who was either kkk member or an americain hero depending on who you ask.</p>
<p>You went staight past, vague but consentous to improve the problem of police violence, to two competing thoeries of expanding police power.</p>
<p>The first is clear, trump is running on law and order. The arm of the repubicain party known as fox new has been showing images of voilence consistently.</p>
<p>What is far less obvious is that biden/harris is a dog wistle for law and order. If we presume that independent voters do an entire minute of research, a big ask but bare with me; they should find that either joe &ldquo;crime bill&rdquo; biden in fact added 80 something crimes to the death penelty list and expanded police power, and that harris is considered an over zealous proscutor. Biden alone is a blank slate that pushes in whatever the dnc decides should be the next president; or the maybe anti-bernie but doubling down on the feature of law and order democrates speaks that it was intended.</p>
<p>Continuing the violence isn&rsquo;t helping the case that the state is unnecessary or evil. For whatever reason this murder entered the public consensus, a rare event; and you wasted it, rotted it and left it out to smell. Fuck you ancoms this moment was valuable; learn from this mistake.</p>
