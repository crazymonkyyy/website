    <p>The sea, not space is the next frontier, it&rsquo;s quite a bit closer and economical to send settlers there. 2/3rds of the earth surface is actually unclaimed by nation-states and while there are challenges for making it work, likely internet access with being expensive and slow, it not speculative high concept engineering to live there.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there are two ongoing attempts and I have complaints about both, and would quickly like to suggest a 3rd.</p>
<p>To quickly summarize the other two, Chad Elwartowski and the seasteading institute:</p>
<p>Chad, some bitcoin investor ordered to have a seasteading house built, this tiny shack, and then hired out so boats to drag it out off the coast of Thailand. He is was/being tried for treason by Thailand with the death plenty being talked about and decided to not deal with it and abandoned the small shack.</p>
<p>On the drastic, another side of the spectrum is the seasteading institute. Which produces many artist renditions of what seastead could look like and it&rsquo;s all super sci-fi and is in talks with some small nation to get some legal permission to do it. I.e. minarchists cucks.</p>
<p>If my opinion is clear from how I described them, I think chad is based but stupid, and I think the seasteading institute will be endlessly tied up in talks forever and I&rsquo;m not all interested in asking permission.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, there are already floating cities that flout laws; cruise ships. They aren&rsquo;t self-sustainable and I honestly think they are shitty entitlement capitalism to the core but&hellip;. well they exist and aren&rsquo;t being tried for treason.</p>
<p>So as a core idea, you, yes you, ancap billionaire with your bitcoin. You go buy a used small cruise ship and park it off the American coast or a related western country with a strong culture for individualism and start selling sections of the ship.</p>
<p>Here are some throwing shit at the wall industries to look into:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Quiet bed and breakfast. Cuirseships survive off tourism, mixing low labor costs with middle-class money. You could do much the same, but I would pull back on the entitlement, the 24/7 buffet, and shows, etc. just a room near water and likely an interesting culture is a vacation enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saltwater experimental crops. There are experimentalists in this space looking at this idea, in theory, you could make some deal with a researching university one wanting to make crops in seawater and use these crops to supplement the local diet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drug manufacturing, I would travel to have one of the experimental LSD + therapist treatments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gambling. Las Vegas exists, and that dessert isn&rsquo;t pleasant.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>I would note you likely could invite some of the illegal immigrants for low-cost labor like with the cruise industry in general&hellip; but treat them better, rent them out small spaces for restaurants and other self-employment rather than running them ragged with 16 hour days with the centrally planning that is a cruise ship.</p>
