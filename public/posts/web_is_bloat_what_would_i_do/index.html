    <p>The webshit is webshit, I imagine anyone who manages to find this blog will agree that the socail media web is bad or is a &ldquo;systems&rdquo; programmer who looks at webshit with disgust; so not going into detail, so what would I replace it with?</p>
<p>I see 3 main tasks as part of the web:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Layout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rich text with a focus on links</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generic system aided user messages</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(I would add a 4th, a flash replacement, but that would be another rant.)</p>
<p>Html only managed the 2nd, and the first historically was a nightmare, poeple had space partition trees in thier mind for so long; <strong>my</strong> wm is &ldquo;Binary Space Partition Window Manager&rdquo; and let me tell you, poeple don&rsquo;t think in 1.5d trees they think about layout in grids I like tiling wm&rsquo;s but its still jank. And to my knowlegde no one has solved the thrid problem cleanly.</p>
<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
<p>So, layout is futher sub divided into 2 parts, grid defination and grid coloring.</p>
<p>If you give poeple enough dials in your grid layout they can compose websites that most poeple find pleasing, whether thats think  margins, and collection of images, having a logo at the top corner and a wall of text, whatever. Trational html defined &ldquo;frames&rdquo; which are like the space trees; don&rsquo;t, learn from that mistake. You grab a list of 95% of the definations of css grids poeple ussally poke and allow poeple to define it as the header of the web page. Oh and have muliple for different screen sizes.</p>
<p>Followed by that header is a grid coloring; even if humans think in grids they do this silly thing where they will define content as being bigger then a single grid cell; so you have an n by m 2d array of lets say 8 length strings which will &ldquo;color&rdquo; the boxes. The strings link to a block of text below and boxes that share a &ldquo;color&rdquo; are touching are combined.</p>
<h2 id="rich-text">Rich text</h2>
<p>Markdown is pretty good. The links are a bit of a strange choice but you have blocks of text that is markdown.</p>
<p>Oh and color hints; not color definations; thats a topic I&rsquo;m not super on top of but color multiplication is possible, so the user would have thier system theme that has a list of colors, a dark theme would have white text on black and light theme would have black text on white, a web site could ask that thier background is more blue and broswer would make a dark blue for the dark theme and a light blue for the blinding theme via some sort of color muliplier.</p>
<p>So you have a header of the name of the content for the layout, some color hints, with a block of text of probaly an expanded markdown; like my blog is generated from markdown, its functional.</p>
<p>Lets say when injecting an image or a video in markdown that the file type determines what subsystem renders it.</p>
<h2 id="system-aided-user-messages">System aided user messages</h2>
<p>So this is the tricky bit, defining the 2 way communication; this would also go into the grid coloring system. And some heading.</p>
<p>Fundmentally what a pizza site is doing with its layers and layers of js is asking you for an order and some bank info; this is a message. And users are not going to be learning its internal data system and would be very upset if they moved things around during a refactor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d point at zenity (it creates popup windows for bash scripts, like files manager, calenders etc.), and some posix. You have some posix syntax to generate a file with some user help and a system of envermental varibles like say $VISAID, and it will generate and send a text file according to some spefication when the user hits send.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makepiza&rdquo; of the pizza website could append $temporderdetails while &ldquo;checkout&rdquo; could be something like, encypt(pizzasitekey,$temporderdetails $VISAID userinput &ndash;tip &ldquo;20.00 usd&rdquo;)</p>
