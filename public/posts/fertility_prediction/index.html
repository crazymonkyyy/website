    <p>I believe with 95% confidence you&rsquo;re going to see a class of women with long-term fertility issues from being given these corona vaccines.</p>
<p>Some facts:</p>
<p>Vaccines are supposed to stay in your arm, so the toxicity is minimized. These vaccines and maybe the method itself don&rsquo;t it roams around the body.</p>
<p>The protein itself is toxic.</p>
<p>There is a censorship campaign to silence people reporting strange symptoms, which are quite varied and strange. Not that people tell their doctors all symptoms anyway.</p>
<p>For some reason, it&rsquo;s concentrating in the uterus.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s is an increase in miscarriages. (It will take 9 months to see the worse of it)</p>
<p>Is it&rsquo;s highly likely the following is true:</p>
<p>The majority of women have toxic protein in their uterus.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t an evolved method to handle this toxicity, <em>there,</em> unlike say lung tissue which young people handle flu-like illness doing their shit yearly. (What mechanism delievers hostile material from the lungs to the uterus?)</p>
<p>Long-term damage is happening.</p>
<hr>
<p>At the rate that people admit that corona came from a lab, something I think I believed that January, it could be 5 years before all these facts are &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; and a decade before the story is explained dryly to the public, but I&rsquo;m quite sure about this. There&rsquo;s strange toxicity in the uterus, there will be issues that come from this and I&rsquo;m ever more disappointed in humanity and the unbelievable incompetence of these systems.</p>
