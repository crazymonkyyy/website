    <p>So, valve has stopped dev on artifact for the 2nd time.</p>
<p>&hellip;..</p>
<p>sadness, pure sadness, I put so much money in. Money, I shouldn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>I liked both versions.</p>
<p>Anyway, so last year I loved 3 complex games, artifact, artifact 2 electric boogaloo, and 5d chess.

<p>The story with each is the same I feel, an insanely steep learning curve with a first-order strategy that hurts the new players, into a decline in play base and this handful of theory crafters solving the high end of the game without the devs reacting to balance problems.</p>
<p>With artifact 1, it was red having the strongest heroes by a large margin and a very strong 1 card win condiction in a game where heroes weren&rsquo;t random in a game with a lot of randomnesses. Red needed to be nerfed hard and quickly, the market valued ax at some absurd price because he was in both easy-to-play strong decks mono-red and ramp green red.</p>
<p>With artifact 2, I&rsquo;m less sure I didn&rsquo;t get an invite till late last year, but there&rsquo;s a lot of agro black that&rsquo;s quite tricky to survive&hellip;. it was less extreme mostly any theoretical player base hated valve. So no player base was picked up.</p>
<p>With 5d chess there&rsquo;s a 3 move opening that exposes the king&hellip; when the king is very weak and the dev was too slow to add &ldquo;princess&rdquo; a variant where the queen is weakened to be rook + bishop and not the trigonally, quadgonally moving, &ldquo;random&rdquo; checkmate machine. That the queen was extremely strong should have been seen very early and I have trouble imagining that wasn&rsquo;t something considered even prerelease. But it was quite late and not a first-week patch.</p>
<hr>
<p>I kinda want to make my own &ldquo;5d&rdquo; game, but I have zero belief in my ability to balance such a thing when I clearly can&rsquo;t understand other peoples perspective why they dropped these games, soooo, heres my advice for any such games in the future:</p>
<p>You can not be perfect information deterministic like 5d chess; with such a large attack surface and presumably the type of player who will find a clever degenerate stat. the criticism of artifact 1 about being too random doesn&rsquo;t really apply, the heroes as big numbers i.e. the red heroes weren&rsquo;t that random, any red hero would kill any blue hero so only really very high-level play saw blue existence.</p>
<p>You need a causal mode that removes details for new players to play new players, the hero draft of artifact 2 seems to be helpful here and maybe with it being free, there will be a player base for a while.</p>
<p>You need drastic balance levers you pull quickly.</p>
<p>Randomness needs all the dev talk on input vs output, and information horizons likely need to be skillfully done.</p>

<p>(So everyone take some nootropics/cocaine and stop leaving these types of games without playerbases)</p>
